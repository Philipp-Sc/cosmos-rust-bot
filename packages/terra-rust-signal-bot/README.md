### [Install](#install) Â· [Usage](#usage)  
 
This package includes a Signal Messenger integration that can be used to obtain the latest informaction directly from the terra-rust-bot. 

> :warning: It is recommended to use a dedicated Signal account for terra-rust-bot.

> :warning: Currently there is no local encryption for the linked Signal account. If the system is compromised your Signal account is vulnerable. This will be addressed in upcoming releases. 


## How it works
 
#### Configuration
* The current state from terra-rust-bot is written to **./packages/terra-rust-bot-output/terra-rust-bot-state.json**. Terra-rust-signal-bot reads the file and extracts the information needed.	 
 

## Install
 

**Build terra-rust-signal-bot**

* `cd ./packages/terra-rust-signal-bot`
* `./install.sh dev`

* After that you should be able to run:  
* `./terra-rust-signal-bot help` 

* To link your signal account you will need to scan a QR-Code with your phone.   
* `./terra-rust-signal-bot link-device -s production -n terra-rust-signal-bot`
* You can use the *send* and *receive* command to test the connection.
 
 
## Usage

### Run terra-rust-signal-bot
 
* If you already started the terra-rust-bot then you can use the terra-rust-signal-bot.

* `cd ./packages/terra-rust-signal-bot`
* `./run.sh activate` (run the signal-bot)
* `./stop.sh` (stop the signal-bot)

* Within your **Signal Messenger App** in your Contact search bar type **"Notes to Self"**. Open the channel and write "\help" to see a list of all available commands.
