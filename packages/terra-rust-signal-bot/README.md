## How it works
 
#### Configuration
* The current state from terra-rust-bot is written to **./packages/terra-rust-signal-bot/terra-rust-bot-state.json**. Terra-rust-signal-bot reads the file and extracts the information needed.	 
 

## Install

> Tested on Linux.
> Tested on Windows Subsystem for Linux / Ubuntu.

**Build terra-rust-signal-bot**

* `cd ./packages/terra-rust-signal-bot`
* `./install.sh dev`

* After that you should be able to run:  
* `./terra-rust-signal-bot help` 

* To link your signal account you will need to scan a QR-Code with your phone.   
* `./terra-rust-signal-bot link-device -s production -n terra-rust-signal-bot`
* You can use the *send* and *receive* command to test the connection.
 
 
## Usage

### Run terra-rust-signal-bot
 
* If you already started the terra-rust-bot then you can use the terra-rust-signal-bot to either directly view the state or to activate the signal-bot.

* `cd ./packages/terra-rust-signal-bot`
* `./run.sh receive-loop` (run the signal-bot)
* `./stop.sh` (stop the signal-bot)

* `./terra-rust-signal-bot local-display -m "\help"  ` (to view the state directly)
* replace `"\help"` with any other command to view the state.
