### [Install](#install) Â· [Usage](#usage)

> :warning: It is recommended to use a dedicated Signal account for cosmos-rust-bot.

> :warning: The Signal Configuration is kept in-memory and secured via the [secrets crate](https://github.com/stouset/secrets)

## How it works

#### Configuration

* Cosmos-rust-bot writes the current data (via cosmos-rust-interface) to a file called cosmos-rust-bot-state.json.
* The file serves as database for **cosmos-rust-signal-bot** to handle commands/notifications.


* Errors: there are errors that hinder cosmos-rust-bot in any way.
* Logs: a new transaction was made on behalf of the user.
* Inactivity (threshold is 60s): the cosmos-rust-bot was unable to gather updated information in the given timeframe.
  This is helpful to detect when the bot is not running correctly. Be aware if the internet connection on the system
  signal-bot is running on is down you will not get any notifications.

The commands are shown in the **Usage** section.

## Install

**Build terra-rust-signal-bot**

* `cd ./packages/terra-rust-signal-bot`
* `./install.sh dev`

* After that you should be able to run:
* `./terra-rust-signal-bot help`

* To link your signal account you will need to scan a QR-Code with your phone.
* `./terra-rust-signal-bot link-device -s production -n terra-rust-signal-bot`
* You can use the *send* and *receive* command to test the connection.

## Usage

### Run terra-rust-signal-bot

* If you already started the cosmos-rust-bot then you can use the terra-rust-signal-bot.

* `cd ./packages/terra-rust-signal-bot`

*The signal client is still experimental.  
The following script is configured to restart the signal-bot in case it crashes unexpectedly.*

* `./run.sh` (run the signal-bot)
* `./stop.sh` (stop the signal-bot)


* Within your **Signal Messenger App** in your Contact search bar type **"Note to Self"**. Open the channel and write "
  \help" to see a list of all available commands.
