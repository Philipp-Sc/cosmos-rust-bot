> :information_source: The bot was stress tested during the UST crash, it successfully prevented liquidations as it was set up to do.

> :information_source: As a result of the crash, this bot is shifting its focus to Cosmos. Terra related functionalities will be restored the days following the Terra 2.0 rebirth.

## New Roadmap:

**Technical**
- [ ] Refactor to Cosmos-rust-bot 
- [ ] CosmWasm v.1.0.0: Use gRPC instead of LCD/FCD using [cosmos-rust](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-rust/).
- [ ] Signal: In-Memory ConfigStore  

**Cosmos Ecosystem** 

**Terra 2.0**
- [ ] Market Dashboard: List prices (Terraswap, Astroport, Loop) 
- [ ] Impermanent Loss Protection (Astroport, Spectrum)
- [ ] DCA (assets,pools)
- [ ] Arbitrage: Notifications, Automation (including Terra pools on Osmosiszone)
- [ ] Automation: Strategy: Take Profits & Diversify (reducing single point of failure risk)

**Osmosis**
- [ ] Osmosiszone Dashboard: (assets,pools,prices)
- [ ] Impermanent Loss Protection (Osmosiszone) 
- [ ] DCA (assets,pools)
- [ ] Automation: Strategy: Take Profits & Diversify (reducing single point of failure risk)

**Interface**
- [ ] Add commands to quickly/conveniently broadcast transactions via Terminal/Signal Messenger

## About

**CRB** is currently undergoing a rewrite. Available functionality will be described here shortly.

It is intended to be used by **coders, developers and technically-skilled users** to make use of automation.    
At the same time **CRB** can be compiled to a single executable that is easy to use with few dependencies. Making it
easy to deploy and use right away.

In short it's purpose is to have a bot on your side:

**users**
- Save you the hassle of managing your positions manually
- Enable you to run strategies only bots can execute
- Receive alerts and notifications
- Send commands for the bot to execute

**devs**
- Provide insights into the Cosmos Ecosystem
- Enable developers to write their own bot
- Showcase how to use [cosmos-rust](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-rust/)
- Rust

Feature list:

- to be updated after CosmWasm v.1.0.0 refactoring.
 
## Summary

- I created this bot to learn about smart contracts, the Terra blockchain and to get to know the Rust programming
  language. Post-attack the journey continues with a stronger focus on the broader Cosmos ecosystem.
- Cosmos-rust-bot is a constant work in progress: **Bug Reports** and **Feature Requests** are welcome!
- Thanks to the people who helped me along the way on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/EuKCeGFb93">terra
  discord </a>. :heart:
- Special thanks to [PFC Validator](https://pfc-validator.github.io/) for being super helpful and providing their rust tooling open source.

## Support!

You do not need to donate to me, but I will be very happy if you can.
