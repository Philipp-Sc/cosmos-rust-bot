## About

**CRB** is currently undergoing a rewrite. Available functionality will be described here shortly.

It is intended to be used by **coders, developers and technically-skilled users** to make use of automation.    
At the same time **CRB** can be compiled to a single executable that is easy to use with few dependencies. Making it
easy to deploy and use right away.

In short it's purpose is to have a bot on your side:

**users**

- Save you the hassle of managing your positions manually
- Enable you to run strategies only bots can execute
- Receive alerts and notifications
- Send commands for the bot to execute

**devs**

- Provide insights into the Cosmos Ecosystem
- Enable developers to write their own bot
- Showcase how to use [cosmos-rust](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-rust/)
- Rust

## Summary

- I created this bot to learn about smart contracts, the Terra blockchain and to get to know the Rust programming
  language. Post-attack the journey continues with a stronger focus on the broader Cosmos ecosystem.
- Cosmos-rust-bot is a constant work in progress: **Bug Reports** and **Feature Requests** are welcome!
- Thanks to the people who helped me along the way on the terra discord. :heart:
